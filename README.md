# Unithree

This is a passion project of mine. I love using `ThreeJS` and I love using `Unity 3D`. `ThreeJS` is however a rendering
engine and not a game engine, so I wanted to create a highly extensible framework where it is easy to add your own
functionality to make *Real-time Interactive Applications*. After working in some very restrictive `ThreeJS` based tools
I wanted to make something that is easy to use and gives power to the developer to add features themselves. I hope to
add more features as I go, while maintaining a lean core package. This is built be an individual developer with a
full-time job, so be aware that changes may not always come the fastest.

## Overview

A 3D framework built on the highly performant [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) with the intention of being easy to pickup
for users of [Unity 3D](https://unity.com). This is not a recreation of Unity 3D but a highly extensible framework
inspired by it and entity/component models.

## Packages

### Core

The core Unithree system. This is required for any Unithree project.

### Examples

The place to find examples for all Unithree packages.

## Roadmap

* React Three Fiber support
* Unity 3D editor plugin for scene editing
* Physics `ProcessorPlugin` and `component` library
* Loader library. Scenes, models, etc...
* More TBD
