# Unithree

## Goal

A 3D framework built on the highly performant [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) with the intention of being easy to pickup
for users of [Unity 3D](https://unity.com). This is not a recreation of Unity 3D but an extensible framework inspired
by it.

## TODO:

* Add input demo
* Figure out camera implementation (Entity or component)
